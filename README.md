Welcome to AntiYC, where being a YC reject is your golden ticket.

We're not just another VC, we're not even a VC, we're a motley crew of YC cast-offs betting big that our gang of misfits will outshine the polished, overpriced YC breed. Our only entry fee? Your YC rejection slip.

Here's our battle cry: We believe the true mavericks, the young hacker rejects, are destined to build the world‚Äôs most groundbreaking companies. It's you reading this. Rejection isn‚Äôt just part of our journey; it‚Äôs our badge of honor, the fuel for our fire, the chip on our shoulder. This isn‚Äôt just a quirky experiment; it's a rebellion with a purpose.

At AntiYC, we embrace the underdogs‚Äîthe ones who don‚Äôt fit the mold, who wear mismatched socks, and whom other people call strange or weird. We‚Äôre the relentless, the resilient, the ones laughed out of the room. We're the pesky fly that refuses to be swatted, the pebble poised to topple Goliaths.

Our manifesto? We don't promise an easy ride. Instead, we offer solidarity in an armada of scrappy pirate ships. We're the trench fighters, the frontline warriors, the ones who rise from the ashes of rejection to change the damn world. We are at the pointy end.

Join us and sign a 1% SAFE for $1.00 USD. It's not about the money. You'll own a proportional piece of the whole motley fleet, just like every other proud degenerate here. We're the first dollar in your war chest.

And the master plan? We'll trade software and tools among ourselves, generating mad ARR and MRR, ready to take the business world by storm. We're not just a club; we're a revolution.

This is the Pirate Manifesto of AntiYC. Join us, and let's show the world what the rejects can really do.

## AntiYC AntiClub

Ahoy, startup outcasts and YC rejects! Welcome to AntiYC's first foray: funding a horde of rebellious startups.

Think of us as you. You won't be shackled to an office desk at 9 AM. Instead, you're the captain of your ship, working on your time, in your space. We throw you the loot ‚Äì seed funding, not a salary ‚Äì not enough, it's $1. But it was never about the money, it's about outsiders becoming insiders. The chosen few, the 2%. The community. We're the other 98%, the employees working nights and weekends, building, building, building while your doing whatever it is your doing. We don't think in 24/7/365 or 996 or Q or month. We're just fucking building. Chipping away. Climbing. At the pointy end. Rejection and failure is our lifeblood. We're the person before they were that person. The human underneath, behind the curtain, mostly invisible. By design.

What happens when light fades? Your call, captain. Mothball, keep sailing, or dissolve it ‚Äì no hard feelings. If your venture shows promise and you've got the guts to continue, we'll be there, ready to help you plunder more funding. $1USD at a time. If you fail, join another ship.

Here's the deal for the accepted scallywags: we handle the boring stuff. Incorporation, bank accounts, basic agreements ‚Äì consider it done. Patent advice is on the house too, but that's for later worries.

Our crew of savvy mentors is ready to parley about your plans, pitfalls, and bright ideas. You'll have access to our network, but how much you plunder from our connections and advice is your call.

We'll rally once a week for a feast, a chance to mingle with fellow founders and hear tales from seasoned tech, business, or legal pirates. But don't expect us to meddle in your affairs like those traditional VC landlubbers. We're not about controlling your board or your CEO choice. Work from whatever den or hideout you find; many great ventures have started in such lairs.

Anyone can join, but we're on the lookout for teams ‚Äì a blend of seasoned and fresh pirates. We value people over everything. Show us you're more than just talk, that you can navigate more than just 'Blub' seas.

We expect you to start with a plan but be ready to steer as the winds change. Sticking rigidly to your original course might just mean you're sailing blind.

No need for formal plans; just join our cause. If we like your spirit, we'll invest directly in you first, to get you set up. If you're not yet a formal crew (incorporated), we'll help you get there. The treasure ‚Äì funding ‚Äì is yours to use as you deem fit for your venture.

We're betting on a few, so we're not throwing heaps of gold at each crew. We're keeping it lean ‚Äì think of it as more swashbuckling, less baggage.

This isn't just a wild sail; it's real venture funding. We're in it for the gold, not just the glory. So, bring us ideas that promise more than just a good time. Show us you're here to conquer the startup seas.

Dive in, startup pirates! The sea of opportunity awaits. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüöÄüí∞
