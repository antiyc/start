Make something rejects want.

Welcome to the Pirate Manifesto of AntiYC

Ahoy, YC rejects and startup outcasts! Welcome aboard AntiYC ‚Äì not just another VC, not even a VC. We're a motley crew of misfits, united by our YC rejection slips, ready to outshine the overhyped YC elite.

We are the 98%, the relentless hackers, and builders working beyond the constraints of 9-to-5. Our journey is carved from rejection and failure, the lifeblood of our ambition. We're the unseen, the underdogs, the ones laughed out of the room, poised to topple Goliaths.

## Here's our creed:

### Freedom:
You're the captain of your ship, steering your course in your time. No desks, no traditional hours. Just build, chip away, and climb.
### Support:
We handle the mundane ‚Äì incorporation, bank accounts, basic agreements. Patent advice? On the house.

### Community:
Join our weekly feasts, mingle with fellow founders, and learn from seasoned tech, business, and legal pirates.

### Mentorship:
Savvy mentors are ready to parley about your plans and ideas. Plunder as much as you can from our network and advice.

### Flexibility:
Your venture, your call. Mothball, keep sailing, or dissolve with no hard feelings. If you show promise and guts, we're here to back you, $1USD at a time.

At AntiYC, we embrace the strange, the resilient, the pioneers before they became known. We're not about controlling your board or CEO choice. Work from wherever, because greatness can sprout from the most unlikely places.

We seek teams ‚Äì a blend of seasoned and fresh pirates. All rejects welcome. Show us you're more than talk, able to navigate more than just 'Blub' seas. Be ready to adapt, as sticking rigidly to your original course might mean sailing blind.

# Our manifesto is clear:

### Solidarity:
An armada of scrappy pirate ships, each owning a proportional piece of the fleet.
### Innovation:
Trading software and tools, generating mad ARR and MRR, ready to take the business galaxy by storm.
### Venture:
Real funding for real ventures. We're in it for the gold, not just the glory. Bring ideas that conquer, not just entertain.

This isn't just a quirky experiment or a wild sail. It's a revolution, a rebellion with a purpose. Join us at AntiYC, sign a 1% SAFE for $1.00 USD, and let's show the world what the rejects can really do.

Degenerate - founders, rejects, captains of ships.

## Our Thesis
In the next century, the landscape of trillion-dollar companies will undergo a radical transformation. These behemoths of tomorrow won‚Äôt emerge from the well-trodden paths of San Francisco or under the auspices of Y Combinator (YC). Instead, they will be the brainchildren of the overlooked and underappreciated ‚Äì the rejects, misfits, and weirdos who think outside conventional paradigms.
