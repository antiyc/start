Welcome to the AntiYC Club, where being a YC reject is your golden ticket. We're not just another VC; we're a motley crew of YC cast-offs betting big that our gang of misfits will outshine the polished, overpriced YC breed. Our only entry fee? Your YC rejection slip.

Here's our battle cry: We believe the true mavericks, the young hacker rejects, are destined to build the world‚Äôs most groundbreaking companies. Rejection isn‚Äôt just part of our journey; it‚Äôs our badge of honor, the fuel for our fire. This isn‚Äôt just a quirky experiment; it's a rebellion with a purpose.

At AntiYC, we embrace the underdogs‚Äîthe ones who don‚Äôt fit the mold, who wear mismatched socks, and don‚Äôt own a single Patagonia vest. We‚Äôre the relentless, the resilient, the ones laughed out of the room. We're the pesky fly that refuses to be swatted, the pebble poised to topple Goliaths.

Our manifesto? We don't promise an easy ride. Instead, we offer solidarity in an armada of scrappy pirate ships. We're the trench fighters, the frontline warriors, the ones who rise from the ashes of rejection to change the damn world.

Join us and sign a 7% SAFE for just $1.00. You'll own a proportional piece of the whole motley fleet, just like every other proud degenerate here. We're the first dollar in your war chest.

And the master plan? We'll trade software and tools among ourselves, generating mad ARR and MRR, ready to take the business world by storm. We're not just a club; we're a revolution.

This is the Pirate Manifesto of AntiYC. Join us, and let's show the world what the rejects can really do. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüí•üöÄ


We bet anyone $1 that our $1,000 fund outperforms the W23 YC batch over 10 years.
Demo day is

Degenerate - founders, the captains of your ships.
Investors - write checks into degenerate founder startups.
Mentor - give a talk, guide us, help us not fuck up.
Press - write things that get clicks





## AntiYC Founders Program

Ahoy, startup outcasts and YC rejects! Welcome to AntiYC's first foray: funding a horde of rebellious startups this summer.

Think of our Founders Program like a pirate's summer raid. You won't be shackled to an office desk at 9 AM. Instead, you're the captain of your ship, working on your time, in your space. We throw you the loot ‚Äì seed funding, not a salary ‚Äì enough to keep you afloat for the summer as you build your own venture.

What happens when summer fades? Your call, captain. Mothball your startup, keep sailing, or dissolve it ‚Äì no hard feelings. If your venture shows promise and you've got the guts to continue, we'll be there, ready to help you plunder more funding.

Being a Summer Founder isn't about abandoning school. It's about using your summers to forge a company you can dive into full-time post-graduation. Even if your venture walks the plank by summer's end, you're still leagues ahead of any ordinary summer job. You'll have braved the high seas of startup life, a tale worthy of any resume.

Here's the deal for the accepted scallywags: we handle the boring stuff. Incorporation, bank accounts, basic agreements ‚Äì consider it done. Patent advice is on the house too, but that's for later worries.

Our crew of savvy mentors is ready to parley about your plans, pitfalls, and bright ideas. You'll have access to our network, but how much you plunder from our connections and advice is your call.

We'll rally once a week for a feast, a chance to mingle with fellow founders and hear tales from seasoned tech, business, or legal pirates. But don't expect us to meddle in your affairs like those traditional VC landlubbers. We're not about controlling your board or your CEO choice. Work from whatever den or hideout you find; many great ventures have started in such lairs.
Anyone can apply, but we're on the lookout for teams ‚Äì a blend of seasoned and fresh pirates. We value people over everything. Show us you're more than just talk, that you can navigate more than just 'Blub' seas.

We expect you to start with a plan but be ready to steer as the winds change. Sticking rigidly to your original course might just mean you're sailing blind.

No need for formal plans; just fill out our application. If we like your spirit, we'll invest directly in you first, to get you set up. If you're not yet a formal crew (incorporated), we'll help you get there. The treasure ‚Äì funding ‚Äì is yours to use as you deem fit for your venture.

We're betting on a few, so we're not throwing heaps of gold at each crew. We're keeping it lean ‚Äì think of it as more swashbuckling, less baggage.
This isn't just a wild sail; it's real venture funding. We're in it for the gold, not just the glory. So, bring us ideas that promise more than just a good time. Show us you're here to conquer the startup seas.

Dive in, startup pirates! The sea of opportunity awaits. üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüöÄüí∞
